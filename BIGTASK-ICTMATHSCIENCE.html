    <center> <h1> <b> SCIENCE - CLIMATE CHANGE </b> </h1> </center>
    
    <h2> <b> What is Climate Change? </b> </h2>
    <p> Climate change refers to significant long-term changes in the average weather conditions of a region, such as becoming warmer, wetter, or drier over several decades or longer. It includes global warming (the rise in Earth's average temperature) and its broader effects on the climate system. </p>
    
    <h2> <b> Causes of Climate Change </b> </h2>
    <p>The current rise in global temperatures is primarily driven by human activities, especially since the Industrial Revolution. The main causes include:</p>

    <p> <b> Burning fossil fuels:</b> Coal, oil, and gas release greenhouse gases.</p>
    <p> <b> Deforestation:</b> Reduces the number of trees that absorb carbon dioxide. </p>
    <p> <b> Agricultural and industrial activities: </b> Emit methane and other gases. </p>
    

    <h2><b>Effects of Climate Change </b> </h2>
    <p> Climate change has severe environmental impacts, including:</p>

    <p> <b>Extreme Weather:</b> More intense storms, heatwaves, and droughts.</p>
    <p> <b>Wildfires:</b> Increased frequency and severity due to hotter, drier conditions.</p>
    <p> <b>Glacier and Ice Loss:</b> Thawing permafrost, shrinking glaciers, and declining sea ice in polar regions.</p>
    <p> <b>Habitat Destruction:</b> Expanding deserts and loss of biodiversity.</p>
    <p> <b>Food and Water Scarcity:</b> Declining crop yields and fish populations.</p>
    <p> <b>Rising Sea Levels:</b> Threatening coastal communities.</p>
    

    <h2><b> Solutions and Activities to Address Climate Change </b> </h2>

    <p>To mitigate climate change, individuals and communities can engage in the following actions: </p>
    <p> <b>Reducing Fossil Fuel Use: </b> Using renewable energy sources like solar and wind power.</p>
    <p> <b>Afforestation and Reforestation: </b> Planting more trees to absorb carbon dioxide.</p>
    <p> <b> Energy Efficiency: </b> Using energy-efficient appliances and reducing electricity consumption. </p>
    <p> <b>Sustainable Transportation: </b> Walking, cycling, using public transport, or driving electric vehicles. </p>
    <p> <b> Waste Reduction:</b> Recycling, composting, and minimizing single-use plastics. </p>
    <p> <b> Advocacy and Education: </b> Raising awareness and supporting policies that combat climate change. </p>
    

    <h2> <b> Climate vs. Weather </b> </h2>

    <p> <b> Weather: </b> Short-term atmospheric conditions in a specific place and time. </p>
    <p> <b> Climate: </b> Long-term average of weather patterns in a region, typically over 30 years or more. </p>
    

    <h2> <b> Five Main Climate Types </b> </h2>

    <p> <b> Tropical Climates: </b> Hot and humid, found near the equator. </p>
    <p> <b> Dry Climates: </b> Arid and semi-arid regions with little rainfall. </p>
    <p> <b> Temperate Climates:</b> Mild summers and winters, found in mid-latitudes. </p>
    <p> <b> Continental Climates: </b> Large temperature variations between seasons. </p>
    <p> <b> Polar Climates: </b> Extremely cold with ice-covered landscapes. </p>
    

    <center> <h1> <b> MATHEMATICS - TRIGONOMETRY </b> </h1> </center>

    <h2> <b> What is Trigonometry? </b> </h2>
    <p> Trigonometry is the branch of mathematics that studies the relationships between the sides and angles of triangles, particularly right-angled triangles. The word comes from the Greek terms: </p>

    <p> <b>"Trigonon" </b> – meaning triangle. </p>
    <p> <b>"Metron" </b> – meaning measure. </p>
    <h2> <b>Right-Angled Triangles</b></h2>


    <p> Trigonometric functions are based on right-angled triangles, which have one angle measuring 90 degrees. The three sides are: </p>

    <p> <b >Hypotenuse: </b> The longest side, opposite the right angle. </p>
    <p> <b> Opposite Side: </b> The side opposite the given acute angle. </p>
    <p> <b> Adjacent Side: </b> The side next to the given acute angle. </p>
    

    <h2> <b> The Six Trigonometric Ratios </b> </h2>

    <p> <b> Sine (sin θ):</b> Opposite / Hypotenuse </p>
    <p> <b> Cosine (cos θ):</b> Adjacent / Hypotenuse </p>
    <p> <b> Tangent (tan θ):</b> Opposite / Adjacent </p>
    <p> <b> Cosecant (csc θ):</b> Hypotenuse / Opposite (reciprocal of sine) </p>
    <p> <b> Secant (sec θ):</b> Hypotenuse / Adjacent (reciprocal of cosine) </p>
    <p> <b> Cotangent (cot θ):</b> Adjacent / Opposite (reciprocal of tangent) </p>
